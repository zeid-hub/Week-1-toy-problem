# GRADE.JS
A function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below:
<ul>Score      Grades
80-100       A
60-79        B
49-59        C
40-49        D
0-40         E
</ul>

# SPEED.JS
A program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

>For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
